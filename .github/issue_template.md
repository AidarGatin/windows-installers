Documentation for the Elasticsearch Windows Installer can be found at

Be sure to select the documentation version relevant to the installer version you
are using.

### Failed Installations

If you are reporting an issue that occurred during installation, we ask that you
attach the installation log file to your issue to help diagnose the root cause.

When installing using the UI, a link to the log file will be provided at the end of a
failed installation. If you have already closed the UI, the log file can be found in
the %TEMP% directory with a randomly generated name adhering to the format MSI<random>.LOG.
It should be the most recent log file.

When installing from the command-line, the log file can be captured by passing the /l*v <logfilename>
flag as per the documentation: 

https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/windows.html#install-msi-command-line
